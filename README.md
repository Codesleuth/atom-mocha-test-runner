# Atom : Mocha test runner

Runs [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) unit tests from within Atom.
It runs:

- a single `it` or `describe` if the cursor is on that particular line
- the test file that's currently open otherwise

It displays the results of the tests in a pane docked to the right.
